Alegcé Kvarzkò lifted his left hand in recognition of the few applauses he was getting as he got up on the small stage. As he approached the small computer that was waiting for him on an elevated desk, he gave up a smile. In front of him were gathered some of the most brilliant minds of theoretical physics and computer science, side by side with innovative and curious people of all horizons. Behind him, reflecting on a white projection screen, was the first slide of his presentation; a small geometrical puzzle to keep some minds busy while they were waiting.<br/>
- Hello, he said with a thick accent as people got silent.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Alegcé Kvarzkò, and some of you might know me under this pseudonym. <br/>
He stopped for a moment and looked back at the screen behind him, turning to the next slide. On it was written his name, where he was studying, and his nickname <i>kvrzk</i>.
- Since I know you will all ask me after this presentation, yes it's pronounced koorchk. Oh, and you can just pronounce my name "Alexi" if the real pronounciation is too hard, he said, as knowing laughters rose in the audience. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But who I am is not important.<br/>
