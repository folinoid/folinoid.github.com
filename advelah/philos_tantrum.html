      &nbsp Splattered by the shock of a cold stone hammer on a vigorous young postulate, the foundation of the philosopher's thought quickly vanished in the unstoppable chaos of the human mind.<br/>
      &nbsp It was indeed a rather cold day, and the young man was briksly hopping the hills hoping to arrive on time at the meeting he was headed for. His dark hair was dancing in the morning wind, led by the confident pace of a wandering, but determined mind.<br/>
      &nbsp As he was passing by, a little wood-nibbling creature watched him, following his path with an almost blind determination. For a thing of such size, it was an impressive sight. But the little creature soon let go of this tall noisy passer-by, only to turn around, gazing at the hills below him. Gazing thoughtfully at the mix between high grasses and short bushes, between cute violet flowers and massive curly trees. <i>What a beautiful view</i>, it must have thought. <br/>

    <p>
      &nbsp Or so would the young man wonder for a few minutes. <i>What if?</i> The eternal, ambiguously grammatically correct, two word sentence that haunts all human minds at least once in their short existence.<br/>
      &nbsp But I am not here to play games with you. No. Enough with the fluffy-fiffy metaphors and vague landscape descriptions. I am here to play <em>one</em>, single, soul snatching game with you.<br/>
      &nbsp Let me explain.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp As young philosophers come and go, they leave in their mark the unescapable wave of physical perturbations, seldom observable by any biological eye. But they leave other things, much more interesting monuments. You see, the beauty of social creatures is the constant exchange of information. And so when our young man exclaimed:
      <says>
        - Infamy! If all mortals belonged in the Gods' plans it would imply imperfection!
      </says>
      <says>
        - Silence young fool!
      </says>
      -- which, out of context, did not mean much -- he allowed for rather uncommon events to take place.<br/>
      &nbsp Fortunately, what he said did not make much sens in-context either. <br/>
      &nbsp But little did we know, that little sentence gave the young philosopher's master furious thoughts, which eventually lead to him kissing his wife goodbye on the next morning, as he was leaving for the City, to meet with other masters of the region. In turn making her take a walk with her 5 sheeps at a more happy pace than usual. <br/>
      &nbsp You might think I would like to lead you and your imagination to some unfathomable consequence of a rather unimportant act. But think nothing of it. It will not happen, for the very simple reason that on that particular day, of this particular year, the alignment of causality made possible for a particularly well placed gamma ray to mutate one of the seed of our previsouly encountered wood-nibbling creature, as he was joyfully and strategically placing it in the womb of a fellow member of his species, and thank Zeus, of the opposite sex.<br/>
