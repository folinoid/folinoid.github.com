      I've always hated reading long and tedious descriptions. It's a potentially unpleasant mental exercise. But how I wish I could do it properly. How I wish I could make you imagine the vastness before my closed eyes, the feeling in my impatient mind. I am not very good in the realm of proofs, but I know of one. It's called the constructive proof, because you construct what you lay before your judges. <br/>

      Imagine an endless field of short greenish-yellowish grass. But not too yellow, just enough - in a limit between occasional rain and a harsh sun.<br/>
      With the landscaping tools of your mind, try to allow for some curves. Some shy, some courageous, some too adventurous that break into small light grey dry-rock cliffs. Some like the archs of a clothless woman's tighs. Some like the belly of a muscular warrior.<br/>
      Now, take a different painting brush. A very sparse one. Add some occasional pale bush, with little edible fruits, just ripe, but not too colorful. Add two or three small trees. One like the back of an old man leaning on a walking staff. One like the spidery fingers of a skinny hand. Another with a thick and valiant trunk, but with very few leaves.<br/>
      An attentive reader should start to feel superior, in power, like some divine being. If only such things existed, maybe the comparison would be fair. Alas it is much vaster.<br/>
      Infinitely. Like the small insects that, when one looks down, seem to plague the land, but are really just there, coexisting with their vegetal cousins.<br/>
      But we are going astray. Look up now, because the sky isn't just some weak blueish taint, no. It is a deep and heavy brush that you take, that you plunge in a dark, almost evil blue. And it's everywhere. But it is lit by the sun. Place the sun where appropriate. But be careful. If it's too low, a slight red tint is necessary. If it's at it's zenith, a little of that blinding white.<br/>
      And the birds. Never begin a sentence with and, except if you are talking about birds. Never forget the birds. They might be rare, and hard to spot. They might be up high in the ceilings or down low in the branches. But a birdless sky is, in some hearts, synonym of a life-less picture. They might be feather light, but their chirpy-dirpy chippiting brings so much.<br/>
      You know that.<br/>
      We're almost done. All that is left is some bigger lifeform. Ideally of the roaming type. Choose among those you like. Some would go for some fat little savage pigs, others for some bleating goats. I for one, would go for the proud wild horses.<br/>
      You can put your instruments down now, but make sure you know where you put them. We're going to need them later on. You're going to need them later on.<br/>
      Or even right now.<br/>
